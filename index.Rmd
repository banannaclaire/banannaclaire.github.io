**about the site**

We made this site to showcase the results of our final project data analysis. We analyzed traffic stop data in Charlotte, NC, and we got our dataset [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/officer-traffic-stops-b95e4).

**about us**

Meet the group members: seniors Wyatt, Anna, and Hunter. Wyatt is from Winston-Salem, NC, studying Statistics & Analytics. She's currently a graphic design editor for Coulture, a magazine on campus, and is an all-around boss b*tch. Anna is from Chicago, IL, and pursuing dual majors in ST/AN and Business Administration. She somehow stumbled into full-time employment so she doesn't like to leave her couch, but she did just get a puppy (who has been to class, hopefully unnoticed). Hunter is from Greensboro, NC, also studying ST/AN, and is a mentor for UNC FEMMES on campus. Hunter is also somehow employed. We hope you enjoy our work.
