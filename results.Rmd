**Multiple studies find racial bias in police stops and searches**

Throughout our data analysis, we found that police officers in Charlotte, NC are significantly more likely to stop and search black drivers than any other race. This evidence is also true for police officers across the United States. These findings are not supported by just one or two studies, but a multitude of studies.

In our exploratory analysis, we include a tibble that contains the proportion of each race stopped versus the total proportion searched. The percentage of total Asians searched is 0.006195257, Blacks is 0.783379620, Other/Unknown is 0.008117924, and White is 0.202307199. It is evident that the number of Blacks searched compared to other races is significant.
 
According to The Guardian, black people are eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by officers than white people (Dodd, 2017). The Washington Post states that for years, police records have shown that black drivers are less likely to have guns or drugs when searched at traffic stops. However, black drivers are three times as likely to be searched than white drivers (Guo, 2015). The Miami Herald mentions that Sacramento police stop 1 out of every 4 black adults annually, while only stopping 1 out of every 17 white adults (Chabria & Reese, 2017). ABC News reported that black drivers in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites (The Associated Press, 2017).

*This graph shows that the percentage of population of each race in Chicago is not proportionate to the percentage of traffic stops by each race. The percentages are not slightly different, but significantly different, showing the racial bias in traffic stops by police officers.*

Not only are police stopping blacks more than any other race, but they are also stopping them for unfair or non-legitimate reasons, which contributes to why more blacks are stopped.

According to the Bureau Justice, only about 68 percent of black drivers felt they had been pulled over for a legitimate reason (“Traffic Stops, 2011). A poll from National Public Radio found that 60 percent of black Americans said they or a family member have been stopped or treated unfairly by police because they are black (Neel, 2017).

Along with discrimination towards blacks in the number of traffic stops by police, they are also the race that is most likely to be searched. There are multiple studies that support this evidence. A Slate Magazine article also found that blacks are often searched on the basis of less evidence than whites (Goel & Phillips, 2017).
 
Looking at the t-test from our Charlotte, NC data is it clear that the difference between the proportions of each race getting stopped and the proportion of each race in the population is significant. Specifically, our analysis shows that the Black drivers are 55% of the population that is stopped, and 88% of the population that is searched. This is pretty significant and it makes one wonder why Black drivers are only half of the population that is stopped, but they are more than three-quarters of the population that is searched. This highlights the racial bias in police stops and searches.

Slate Magazine also found that black drivers were searched about twice as often on average than whites (Goel & Phillips, 2017). According to the New York Times, officers in Greensboro searched blacks more than twice as often (LaFraniere & Lehren, 2015). Cops Stops and Race also supports that black people are twice as likely to be searched by police than whites in Connecticut (Ba Tran, 2016). Our analysis shows that the proportion of black drivers who were searched is 78.34% and the proportion of white drivers who were searched is 20.23%. These findings show that black drivers are searched a little less than four times as often than whites. All of these numbers further support our conclusion that police officers are significantly more likely to search black drivers than any other race.

*This graph shows the amount difference that black drivers were more likely to be searched than white drivers in multiple cities. For example, in Charlotte, NC, black drivers were 2.8 times more likely to be searched than white drivers.*  
 
Despite the evidence that black drivers are the most likely to be pulled over and searched, evidence is found that they are the less likely to be found with weapons or drugs. According to an article by ThinkProgress, the likelihood a black New Yorker is found with a weapon is half that of a white New Yorker, and a the likelihood a black New Yorker is found with contraband is one-third less than a white New Yorker. (Shen, 2013) A Vanity Fair article states in San Francisco, “whites searched without consent were found to be carrying contraband at nearly two times the rate as blacks who were searched without consent.” (Makarechi, 2016)
 
These statistics show that there is racial bias in police stops and searches, for no statistical reason that we can find. Police have a lot of power, and don't always use it for good.
