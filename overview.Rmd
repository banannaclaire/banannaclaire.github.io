We chose this dataset for it's current relevancy. Police brutality and racial profiling is at the forefront of our collective political consciousness and we thought that analyzing this data would be a good way to find some kind of understanding of the issues. 

As one of the major cities in North Carolina, the city of Charlotte provides the perfect sample for us to analyze. We found [this article](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article18289739.html) and thought that using traffic stop data from data.gov would be a good place to start.
